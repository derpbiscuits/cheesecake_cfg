### cheesecake_cfg  28th sept 2023
cheesecake peek's cfg.. config_cs2 is the main config (cyka2 is now retired) - with all the binds and video settings (I always update this manually) ,
smoke is for smokes, training is for all the training cfgs, crosshair for crosshair toggles, viewmodels for viewmodel toggles -

viewmodels / copypastas / crosshairs all remain the same, other ones are outdated.

### NVIDIA SHADOWPLAY HELP

- changing binds to "none" just press spacebar - so you can get alt+f11 back
  
  
- be sure to change temp files location
  

- IF THE HOTKEY DOESN'T WORK, TRY ALT + Z FIRST, THEN IF IT DOESNT GO INTO SERVICES.MSC and then restart all things under NVIDIA
  
- if that doesn't work then go to the nvidia geforce folder (program files/nvidia corp) and restart nvidia share

### scenesystem002 error or whatever

- under steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\ 
    
- delete gameinfo.gi (then verify files)

- or game\bin\win64, then delete anything that begins with scenesystem or scenesystem_002 (or for hell the whole folder idk)

- go to [this thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/3819655068777749970/) and try out everything
